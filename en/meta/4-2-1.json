According to \u2018Early Childhood Development Coming of Age: Science through the Life Course\u2019, rapid brain development occurs during the first years of the life. The quality of children\u2019s home environment and their interaction with caregivers play major role in the development of children during the time period. It also helps in boosting cognitive, physical, social and emotional development. </p><p>As per the UNICEF, <strong>a) on track for literacy and numeracy</strong> was classified as 1 if children aged 36-59 months could do at least two of the following tasks: 1) Identify or name at least 10 letters of the alphabet; read at least four simple, popular words and 2) Know the name and recognize the symbols of all numbers from 1 to 0; 0, otherwise</p><p><strong>b) on track for physical development </strong>was classified as 1 if children aged 36-59 months could pick up a small object such as a stick or a rock from the ground with two of their fingers, and/ or the mother or caretaker did not indicate that the child was sometimes too sick to play; and 0 otherwise.</p><p><strong>c) on track for socio-emotional development </strong> was classified as 1 for children aged 36-59 months for whom any of the following two were true: the child got along well with other children; the child did not kick, bite, or hit other children and the child did not get distracted easily; and o otherwise.</p><p><strong>d) on track for learning </strong>was classifies as 1 children aged 36-59 months could follow simple directions on how to do something correctly and/or able to do given task independently; and 0 otherwise.</p><p><strong>e) the overall ECD index </strong>was classified as 1 for children aged 36-59 months who were on track on at least three of the above four indicators; and 0 otherwise.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM":"<p>Global MICS guidelines by UNICEF</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>An international multi-purpose household survey programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s to support countries in collecting internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women, widely known as global MICS programme. It measures key indicators that allows countries to generate data for using in policy making and designing programs, and to monitor progress towards the national goals and global commitments.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The sample for the Nepal MICS 2019 was designed to provide estimates for a large number of indicators on the situation of children and women at the national level, for urban and rural areas and seven provinces. The urban and rural areas within each province were identified as the main sampling strata. Kathmandu valley urban is included as a separate stratum as it\u2019s characteristics differ from the rest. Each stratum was a separate domain. The sample of household was selected in two stages. Within each stratum, at the first sampling stage a specified number of census enumerations areas (EA), was selected systematically with probability proportional to size. A household listing was carried out within the selected enumeration areas, identifying the households with and without children under 5 years. In total, 25 households with and without children under 5 years were selected in each sample enumeration area through systematic random sampling method. To ensure strong representativeness of children under 5 in the sample, household with children under 5 years were oversampled. Hence, 13 households with children under 5 years and 12 households without children under 5 years were selected from listing in each enumeration area. A total sample of 512 enumeration area and 12800 households was selected for the survey. As the sample is not self-weighting, sample weights are used for reporting survey results. </p><p>The sampling frame of Nepal is based on the 2011 National population and Housing Census (NPHC). The census frame is a complete list of all census wards created for the 2011 NPHC. At the time of last census, the urban household population constituted 20% of the total household population. According to the latest changes in the administrative structure, following the federalization of the government, the urban household population increased to 65%. CBS updated the population frame to reflect the current status. In designing the sample for the Nepal MICS, it was very useful to review the sample design and results of the MICS conducted in 2014, documented in the final report of that survey. </p><p>Therefore, a multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample. The primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first stage were the enumeration areas (EAs) defined for the census enumeration. A listing of households was conducted in each sample enumeration area, and a sample of households was selected at the second stage.  </p><p>The questionnaires were developed based on the MICS 6 standard questionnaires of UNICEF. It was customized and translated into Nepali, Bhojpuri and Maithili language. After the development of questionnaire, it was pre-tested in Sindhupalchowk and Sindhuli district during March 2019. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires. </p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>2024</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2024</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>National official statistical agency that is responsible for conducting, survey and census.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Early childhood development (ECD) is very important to shape one\u2019s future.
