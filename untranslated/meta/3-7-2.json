It provides a basic measure of reproductive health focusing on a vulnerable group of adolescent women. The indicators \u2018Adolescent birth rate (aged 10-14 years; aged 15-19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group\u2019 is defined as annual number of births to women  between the age group 10-14 and 15-19 years per 1000 women in that age group.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Annual number of births to females aged 10-14 or 15-19 years per 1,000 females in the respective age group</p>","CLASS_SYSTEM":"<p>Global MICS guidelines by UNICEF</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>An international multi-purpose household survey programme was developed by UNICEF in the 1990s to support countries in collecting internationally comparable data on a wide range of indicators on the situation of children and women, widely known as global MICS programme. It measures key indicators that allows countries to generate data for using in policy making and designing programs, and to monitor progress towards the national goals and global commitments.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The sample for the Nepal MICS 2019 was designed to provide estimates for a large number of indicators on the situation of children and women at the national level, for urban and rural areas and seven provinces. The urban and rural areas within each province were identified as the main sampling strata. Kathmandu valley urban is included as a separate stratum as it\u2019s characteristics differ from the rest. Each stratum was a separate domain. The sample of household was selected in two stages. Within each stratum, at the first sampling stage a specified number of census enumerations areas (EA), was selected systematically with probability proportional to size. A household listing was carried out within the selected enumeration areas, identifying the households with and without children under 5 years. In total, 25 households with and without children under 5 were selected in each sample enumeration area through systematic random sampling method. To ensure strong representativeness of children under 5 in the sample, household with children under 5 were oversampled. Where 13 households with children under 5 and 12 households without were selected from listing in each enumeration area. A total sample of 512 enumeration area and 12800 households was selected for the survey. As the sample is not self-weighting, sample weights are used for reporting survey results. </p><p>The sampling frame of Nepal is based on the 2011 National population and Housing Census (NPHC). The census frame is a complete list of all census wards created for the 2011 NPHC. At the time of last census, the urban household population constituted 20% of the total household population. According to the latest changes in the administrative structure, following the federalization of the government, the urban household population increased to 65%. CBS updated the population frame to reflect the current status. In designing the sample for the Nepal MICS, it was very useful to review the sample design and results of the MICS conducted in 2014, documented in the Final Report of that survey. </p><p>Therefore, a multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling approach was used for the selection of the survey sample. The primary sampling units (PSUs) selected at the first stage were the enumeration areas (EAs) defined for the census enumeration. A listing of households was conducted in each sample enumeration area, and a sample of households was selected at the second stage.  </p><p>The questionnaires were developed based on the MICS 6 standard questionnaires of UNICEF. It was customized and translated into Nepali, Bhojpuri and Maithili language. After the development of questionnaire, it was pre-tested in Sindhupalchowk and Sindhuli district during March 2019. Based on the results of the pre-test, modifications were made to the wording and translation of the questionnaires.</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>2024</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2024</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Central Bureau of Statistics</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>National official statistical agency that is responsible for conducting, survey and census.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p> For the improvement of sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents, rate of adolescent fertility must be reduced and address the multiple factors underlying it. Early pregnancy and child birth has greater risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth. Furthermore, mother and children are subject to be more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce the infant mortality rate. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in a particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>The calculation of this indicator requires to have reliable information on number of live births to women aged 15-19 years. The quality of such information is heavily dependent on the questionnaire design, the sample size and design and the accuracy of respondents' answers.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years.
